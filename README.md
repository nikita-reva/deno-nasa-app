Exploring Deno.

I was taking a first look into Deno. The app is built with the Oak framework and deployed as a Docker container to AWS.

It can be accessed [here](http://52.59.217.74:8000/index.html).

The app is taken from [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/deno-the-complete-guide-zero-to-mastery/) course.
